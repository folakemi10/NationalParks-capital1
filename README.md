# National Park Activity Guide for Capital one

A guide for national parks

## Description
An app to Let visitors search from a list of activities to do at different National Parks
Visitors can click an activity and have the web app display all the National Parks tied to a specific activity
After selecting a specific park, the app should pull up an informational page so the visitor can learn more about the park. 
Visitors can retrieve data from park web cams based on which National Park(s) the user selects. Specifically, this feature should be able to display the non-streaming images collected from park web cams so a visitor can view them with ease.

## Features Implemented
none


## Challenges
I couldn't figure out how to use react router to navigate to a different page on button click so my app doesn't function
